I practiced all SQL queries 
INSERT DATA INTO TABLES,UPDATE DATA IN THE TABLE,DELETE PARTICULAR DATA AND
SELECT queries with conditions, sorting, and limits.

While updating and deleting data faced challenge that rejecting updates and 
deletes with no restrictions .Then we went to SQL editor ,unchecked safe updates.
